# üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions to common issues and errors you may encounter while working with the n8n clone project.

## üöÄ Application Issues

### Application Fails to Start
**Symptom**: The application fails to start with an error message.

**Possible Causes**:
- **Incorrect environment variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set correctly in your `.env` file.
- **Database connection issues**: Verify that the database is running and accessible from the application.
- **Port conflicts**: Check if another application is using the same port.

### Workflow Execution Fails
**Symptom**: A workflow execution fails with an error message.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1.  **Check execution logs**: Review the execution logs in the `execution-history` service for detailed error messages.
2.  **Verify node configuration**: Ensure all nodes in the workflow are configured correctly.
3.  **Check credentials**: Verify that the credentials used in the workflow are valid and have the required permissions.
4.  **Debug the workflow**: Use the built-in debugger to step through the workflow execution and identify the source of the error.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Issues

### Database Connection Errors
**Symptom**: The application cannot connect to the database.

**Possible Causes**:
- **Incorrect database credentials**: Verify the database username, password, and host in your `.env` file.
- **Database server is not running**: Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running.
- **Firewall issues**: Check if a firewall is blocking the connection to the database.

### Slow Queries
**Symptom**: The application is slow, and database queries are taking a long time to execute.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1.  **Analyze query performance**: Use the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command to analyze the query execution plan.
2.  **Add indexes**: Add indexes to the tables to improve query performance.
3.  **Optimize queries**: Rewrite complex queries to be more efficient.

## üê≥ Docker Issues

### Docker Container Fails to Start
**Symptom**: A Docker container fails to start with an error message.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1.  **Check container logs**: Use the `docker logs <container_name>` command to view the container logs.
2.  **Verify Docker installation**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly.
3.  **Check Docker resources**: Make sure Docker has enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to run the containers.
